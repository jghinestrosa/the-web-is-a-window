# the web is a window

The web is a window through which we can access to unlimited resources, infinite knowledge and different point of views.

This window let us take a look to what is oblivious of our personal situation and be part of something bigger. A window through which we get in touch with other people and we can access to their ideas and opinions.

The web is a window through which you can express yourself.

The web as a medium, as a channel, as a window.

## What it does

This extension draws a window on SVG and lets you add it to the bottom of the DOM by an icon located in the location bar. It aims to bring awareness of the web as a window through which you access to the infinite content.
